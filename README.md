# Recipe Card App

## Project Overview

### Description

Ever wanted a space to store all your favourite recipes? Well this is it!

A simple recipe card web app built using the MERN stack. Simply sign up and start creating your own recipe cards.

Although this app seems simple on the surface, I wanted it to be as close to a full production app for a client as I could. Therefore, this seemingly simple app quickly turned into something much bigger below the surface.
