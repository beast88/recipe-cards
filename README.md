# Recipe Card App

## Project Overview

### Description

Ever wanted a space to store all your favourite recipes? Well this is it!

A simple recipe card web app built using the MERN stack. Simply sign up and start creating your own recipe cards.

Although this app seems simple on the surface, I wanted it to be as close to a full production app for a client as I could. Therefore, this seemingly simple app quickly turned into something much bigger below the surface.

### Features

## Development

### Technologies

#### Frontend

- React Router Dom
- Bootstrap
- Axios
- React-Spring - An animation library that helped me bring this project to life.

#### Backend

- Mongoose
- Express
- Node
- Json Web Token
- Crypto
- Nodemailer - This package gave me the ability to send emails to allow users to reset their password.
